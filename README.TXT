Boa Constructor (was Pygasm)
----------------------------

Thanks for checking out Boa Constructor.
Boa is supposed to be a simple Delphi for wxPython.
One of the philosophies I try to keep with is to purely be a time/effort saving
code generator, not a library/framework. This is the principle behind storing
object data as source code code as opposed to some pickled datastructure or
fileformat or something.

Look at Changes.txt for the latest improvements.
Look at Bugs.txt for important info about problems & bugs.

NB: Please unzip Boa to an empty directory
