- Boa Constructor -

Thanks for checking out Boa Constructor.

Boa aims to be a simple Delphi for wxPython.
It is an IDE for Python development including visual wxPython frame
design, object browsers, documentation generation, debugging,
source control (CVS) and much more.
The Boa IDE also integrates with other Python technologies like 
Distutils, Zope, PyChecker.

If you are new to Boa and wxPython, work through the Getting Started Guide
and Tutorial.

Look at Changes.txt for the latest improvements.
Look at Bugs.txt for info about problems & bugs.

If you have an environmental variable set named HOME and the directory
it points to contains a directory named '.boa' (which you must create
yourself on windows) all preferences and config files will be copied to and 
used from this directory.

NB: Please unzip Boa to an empty directory

P.S. The short name is Boa, *not* BOA. 
Boa is not an acronymn, it's the name of a huge Python ;)
