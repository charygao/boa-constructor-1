To do
-----

Features
--------

* Non modal Process dialogs 
* Debug hook for hooking GUI exceptions to the debugger
* Multiple help windows
* File filters

Framework Extensions
--------------------

* Allow submenus under File and Edit
* Define resource files for menus and and menu context help (for i18n)

format: 
[ClassName]
method=('menu', 'OnMethod', 'image/path.png', 'shortcut', 'description')


Missing wxPython features
-------------------------

* wxWizard
* wxArtProvider
* wxAcceleratorTable
* More wxPython.lib controls
  * MaskEdits
* improved wxApp support (properties and events)
* Two step Create and extra style flags


High level features
-------------------

* Correct Syntax Error highlighing
* Better default property handling, possibly cutting some cruft from
  generated source by omitting unchanged defaults.

Detail
------

Documentation
- Tutorial
 - Debugging section
 - Image handling
- Link to method docs from selected property


Editor
- More actions should use the progress bar
- Use Idle extensions
  - The Tkinter editor control interface sucks.
  - As a test, converted the IDLE extension FormatParagraph. See Plug-ins.
    It was quite simple, only had to change the tkinter text control code
    to wxSTC code and write the Boa IDE hooks to publish it under 
    Py:Edit->Format paragraph

- Add toggleable action type
- Look into possibly extending wxApp's stdio redirection to speak to boa
- Goto CVS file from Open Module


Designer
- Multi-select, when moving not all tags snap togeter
- Correctly ordered parameters
- Multi-select/multi-edit, showing a filtering of only properties that can 
  be edited en mass
- Icon support
- Add Palette as Popup menu. e.g. New->Container/Layout->wxPanel
  - Bind Inser to Popup New menu
- Source generation for the new wx.package way of writing

Companions
- Better initial sizes for a few controls


Help
- wx methods help: From Inspector while on property

Documentation View
- Options: 
  - Don't print empty sections (no __doc__ ) 
  - Don't print _private methods

Explore View
- Move method up/down actions
- Switch to explorer view in the class and focused on the
  current method

Tree Views
- Remember which nodes are open and reopen after refreshing

Zope
- CMF, Plone

Debugging
- Preferences to
  - Toggle script debugging
  - Optionally break in with the debugger on top level GUI exceptions using
    sys.excepthook
  - Specify modules and packages which the debugger should not step into


Explorer
- Simple caching for slow connections
- Synch Explorer operations like moving files around with
  any open applications
- Connect opened module if possible to an open app module
- Key mappings!
- Delete directories.
- Improve/Extend the File Dialog enough to stop dependency on the Explorer.
  - E.g. Preference management and Zope support through the File Dialog/Inspector

CVS
- Conflict resolution editor integration
  - Accept, Reject
- Update/Commit/Diff from SourceView
- Visual interface to set options
- Update open modules if a cvs operation modified an
  open module
- Import needs to setup masks for recognised file types
- Run in background/non non modal
- Refesh action
- Colour indication for folders which contain modified files
                            or
- CVS Reports, like search results


App
- App may not have wxDialog as main frame because an app object
  does not quit with dialog as main frame.

Inspector
- Enable/Disable toolbar buttons depending on state
  or only show applicable buttons (not enough space for all btns)

GTK
- Incremental typing lookup on wxListCtrl, hopefully in a base class high up :)

Distutils
- More extension develpoment support
- Attempt to write an InnoSetup distultils target.



Documentation
-

Code changes
- Better support (awareness) for unicode
  - replace type('') testing with isinstance(x, StringTypes)

More filetypes-
- BAT files on windows ?

Roadmap
-------

Boa 1.0
- wxPython IDE with visual frame designer
- Working debugger
- Layout editors
- Integrated source control (cvs)
- Zope Support

Boa 2.0
- Database support
  - DB Aware controls
  - One possibility is hooking a db aware control
    framework to the ZODB
- C/C++ extension writing and possibly debugging support


*
Scriblings
----------

Refactoring tools
* Expand ExploreView to show params & method next to tree
* Refactorings
  * Move selection to method
     - Input: selection, method name
     - Process: Identify local variables
                      Pass vars as parameters
                      Correct indentation

  * Extract common expression
     - Input: common expr (selection), source (selection), new_name
     - Process: Find all occurences of common expr in source
                      Add initialiser above first use of source:
                          new_name = common_expr
                      Replace occurences with new_name

  * Renaming of Classes/Methods/Functions/Modules within an app,
     - This seems incredibly hard to do 100% correct given Python's
       dynamic nature, but there are interesting possibilities in
       post mortem inspection of profiler statistics.
       With a thorough test suite an accurate log of all every
       access to a certain function is recorded.
       This leads to...

  * Testing facilities, how should GUI classes be tested?
     - Window scraping sucks!
     - Look into PyUnit
     - Strategies:
       - Methods (as opposed to event methods) could be tested with doctest.py
         another Tim Peters module :)
         Maybe it can be extended to handle events as follows:
         - List of events that can be posted and assertion of certain
           control values after posting
         I am not very optimistic about this route as none of my own GUI
         objects seem testable in a few lines and usually depend on other
         frames being open/initialised. Nevertheless this needs to be
         pursued and at least those that are testable should be tested.

* Code tools/shortcuts
  * Expand creation params:
    class MyClass(YourClass):
        def __init__(self, param1, param2, ...):
    to:
    class MyClass(YourClass):
        def __init__(self, param1, param2, ...):
            YourClass.__init__(self, param1, param2, ...)
            self.param1 = param1
            self.param2 = param2
            ...

  * Window id registration:
        wxID_*
    to:
    [wxID_*, ...] = map(lambda i: wxNewId(), range(n))

  * Event creation:
        EVT_*(self, id, self.OnEvtFunc)
    to:
        def OnEvtFunc(self, event):
            |



UML
* Update attibutes in uml

Look at Idle's class browser source parser and Idle extensions

_Fundamental changes_

Handle more than one class per source file

Add inheritable components
